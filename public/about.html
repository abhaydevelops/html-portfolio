<p>
  I am a graduate in Mechanical Engineering from the year 2021. I am interested to join the Internet World. 
  Thus I am curious to learn about new technologies.
 </p>

<p>
  Previously I worked in a Mechanical Production Organisation and had experienced proffessional environment.
  I have worked as a Design Engineer Trainee in the organization. 
  I worked there and I found that my interest was more on the background of any network like:
  How these pages are moving on the screen? How this website is functioning?
<p>

<p>
  I gained  interest from there onwards. I took a break and started researching about building a career in this field.
  I started learning new things and gained knowledge about different fields in the internet technology sector.
  I found that Web Development is the field in which I can grow as well as feed my curiousity towards the internet in a better way.
